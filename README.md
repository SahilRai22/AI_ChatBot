# ChatBot

In this project I have built a general-purpose chat bot which is based on Lebron James, and data from the NBA. The chat bot is built to serve multiple functions: stores and manages usernames, prompts day to day commands i.e., asking for the time, instantiates small talk conversations, and finally using an NBA database users can ask about NBA facts. The motivation behind this product, was mainly due to two main interests. I wanted a chat bot which is more like a companion which simulates a human- like conversation and interacts to have a natural flowing conversation
