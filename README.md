## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to create a chatbot that simulates human-like conversation, interacts naturally with users, and provides information related to basketball, reflecting the developer's passion for the sport.

## Background
Chatbots are AI programs that utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis to communicate in human language. This project is based on the Three Pillars of an NLP-Based chatbot, including generating a dialogue system, Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Natural Language Generation (NLG).

The proposed system consists of several key functionalities:
</p>

### Identity Management
- Allows users to set and change their names.
- Recognizes name statements and keywords in queries.
- Implements intent matching techniques for handling administrative tasks.

### Small Talk
- Facilitates natural human-computer conversation.
- Guides users through dialogue to keep them engaged.
- Utilizes NLP techniques, such as TF-IDF and cosine similarity, for response generation.

### Question Answering
- Retrieves information from an NBA knowledge database.
- Integrates trivia questions related to the NBA.
- Follows similar processing methods as Small Talk for response generation.

### Intent Matching
- Recognizes user intents, such as getting the time, date, changing name, and ending the conversation.
- Matches user queries with predefined intents to trigger appropriate actions.

## Evaluation
The chatbot underwent user testing to identify comprehensive problems and limitations. Testing revealed issues related to dialogue flow, name recognition, and dataset size. Further development and refinement are required to improve real-life usage.
